            <p>Hello! My name is Rachel Hernandez. Something about me is that I grew up in Rigby Idaho - I have always loved this part of Idaho! Another thing about me is I absolutely love to travel; I have always found different lifestyles and cultures very fascinating to me. I also love doing outdoor stuff - whether it is hiking, camping, or fishing - count me in! I am the youngest of my 5 siblings (1 sister and 4 brothers), me and my siblings have always been very close to one another. We enjoy doing things as a family, our all-time favorite activity is going fishing at Island Park! </p>
